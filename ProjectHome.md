Includes a generic library for graphs, and running generic algorithms on them. It also features a graphical user interface that allows you to construct graphs and run algorithms on them.

The graph library is header only and does not have any dependencies other than the standard library. The test class uses boost time functions to measure the efficiency. The graphical user interface uses Qt4.
